Power Supply Management (PS-Management) is a GUI Qt Framework-based application for controlling laboratory power supplies of UNI-T UTP330xC and other devices that use the same SCPI.

*PS-Management running on macOS 12.6*

## Features

* Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux) written in Qt
* Full support of the UNI-T UTP330xC
* Fast UI and reaction with a device, adaptive pooling algorithm
* Ease for adding new capable or similar devices

## Getting PS-Management

You can download macOS, Windows (x86 only), and Linux versions from the GitHub [releases tab](https://github.com/vitark/PS-Management/releases) for this project.

## Compiling from source

### Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run this software:
* CMake >= 3.4
* One of these Compilers:
    * GCC >= 4.9
    * clang >= 3.4
    * MSVC >= 16 (Visual Studio 2019)
    * MinGW >= 4.9
* Qt >= 5.15 (Qt5Widgets, Qt5Gui, Qt5Core, Qt5Svg, Qt5SerialPort)

### Compilation

#### macOS and Linux

Compiling PS-Management on macOS and Linux using UNIX make files.

```shell
# download the source code and change it to the directory
# create a build directory
mkdir build
cd build
# run cmake to create makefiles. Use -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH if cmake doesn't find
# your installation of Qt5 or define ENV export e.g. CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/Users/Qt/5.15.2/clang_64/lib/cmake
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
# now compile the source code and create the application. You can speed up
make
```

#### Windows

You can compile the application on Windows using CMake's [Visual Studio Generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators).

```shell
# create a build directory inside PS-Management source directory
mkdir build
cd build
# Assuming you are using Visual Studio 16 2019 windows installation and Qt 5.15.2 installed to D:\\Qt
# Please change these options so they suit your build environment.

# x64 version
cmake -DQt5_DIR="d:\\Qt\\5.15.2\\msvc2019_64\\lib\\cmake\\Qt5"  ../
cmake --build . --target bundle --config Release

# x86 version 
cmake -DQt5_DIR="d:\\Qt\\5.15.2\\msvc2019_64\\lib\\cmake\\Qt5" -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32  ../
cmake --build . --target bundle --config Release
```

### Supported Hardware

Currently, the application only supports UNI-T devices using the [SCPI Protocol](https://github.com/vitark/PS-Management/blob/main/docs/UTP3300C%20English%20manual.pdf). Otherwise, it seems UNI-T devices are rebranded or repacked of [Korad KA300xP](http://koradtechnology.com/) and based on [Korad SCPI Protocol](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Korad_KAxxxxP_series), so Korad devices should to work also or can be accessible to added. Pull Requests for supporting new devices are welcome.

#### Officially supported:
* UNI-T UTP3303C
* UNI-T UTP3305C

#### Not supported, but support can be easily added:
* Korad KA3003P; KA3005P; KA3010P
* Korad KA6002P; KA6003P; KA6005P
* Tenma 72-2535; 72-2540 (rebranded KA30XXP)
* Tenma 72-2545; 72-2550 (rebranded KA60XXP)
* Vellemann PS3005D (rebranded KA3005P)

## USB/COM cable and communications issues
While developing the application, I tried many different cables, USB, and COM (with adaptors)

### USB Cable
Two meters and a longer generic USB2 cable didn't work on my set (Macbook via own USB host). Otherwise, an active USB cable (5m) is working fine. So try to use a USB2 cable as short as possible or an active USB.

### COM (with adaptors)
USB-Serial adaptor (ST Lab, USB-Serial-4, based on PL2303) works fine.
